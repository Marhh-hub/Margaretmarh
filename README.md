# Hey there ! 🖐🏽I'm Margaret - Bwalya if you prefer.

I'm a second year Computer Engineering undergraduate** with a passion for the **automotive industry 🚗🏎** , especially where software meets machines . Whether its embedded systems, vehicle diagnostics, or automation, I'm fascinated by how code drives modern mobility.✈

### 🧩 What I'm working on 
-Developing **C++** and **Python** projects focused on automation  systems.
-Experimenting with embedded development , microcontrollers, and control logic.
- Exploring how technologies like **CAN bus**, **OBD-II**  and **ROS** work under the hood.

### 🛠 My toolbox
- **Languages:** 'C++' , 'Python' some 'C'
- **Tech & Tools:** Git,Linux,Arduino,Raspberry Pi
- **Focus Areas:** Embedded systems, robotics, real-time applications,vehicle            software.

### 🚀 Goals
- Contribute to the future of **vehicle and automation systems** by blending **AI** ,   **mechanical engineering** and ** software development**.
- Collaborate on open-source projects that push the boundaries of whats possible in      mobility.
- Build smarter automotive solutions through both low-level and high-level               programming.
- Learn through hands-on experience and connect with like-minded engineers and           creators.

 ### ⚙ Fun Fact
 I'm more fascinated by **fixing, building, and understanding systems** than just    writing code - I love seeing how everything fits and functions together,            especially in machines.
